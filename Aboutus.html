						<h1> Who We Are </h1>
						<img src="images/linedcadets.jpg"/>
						<p> <a> The Cadet program, or Law Enforcement Explorer program, 
						is an official program of the Town of Fishkill Police Department. 
						The explorer program is a division of Learning-For-Life, which is 
						a section of the Boy Scouts of America. 
						<br>
						<br>
						The explorer program is designed to expose young men and women, aged 14-21, to the vast 
						career choices available in law enforcement today, as well as 
						promoting the growth and development of themselves.
						<br>
						<br>
						Explorers get the incredible opportunity to learn various aspects 
						of the law enforcement field that usually takes many unfortunate 
						new law enforcement personnel some time to learn. Explorers get the 
						opportunity to learn in the classroom as well as in the field. This 
						training includes actual "hands-on" field experience, ride-along programs, 
						and instruction on many law enforcement skills.
						<br>

						<br>
						Cadets are also responsible for various community service as well as 
						law enforcement service duties that include traffic and crowd control 
						at various events, public/ community relation details, various crime 
						prevention details, and various safety details. In addition to this, 
						cadets work shifts along side Police Dispatchers in communications; 
						receiving invaluable hands-on training.
						<br>
						<br>
						The cadets also have the opportunity to participate in the post's 
						Ride-a-Long Program. This aspect is likely the most valuable part of 
						the program. Cadets participating in this program ride with police officers 
						on their normal tour. Cadets have the opportunity to observe and take in various 
						tactics and procedures. In addition, cadets get a better concept and learn the 
						various duties of the officer, his paperwork, and his handling of different situations.
